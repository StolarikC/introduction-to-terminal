    <title>"Mastering" the Terminal</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>"Mastering" the Terminal</h1>
    <p>The terminal allows us to directly communicate with the computer/device.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>KEY ADVANTAGES OF USING THE TERMINAL</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>SPEED!</h3>
            <p>Practice makes perfect! Some concepts may seem pointless or feel frustrating, but once you are familiar
                with the
                terminal, it can be MUCH faster than using a GUI.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>ACCESS!</h3>
            <p>The terminal provides a 'mainline' into the heart of our computer. Giving us access to areas we normally
                don't
                interact with.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>TOOLS!</h3>
            <p>Many of the tools we need are installed and used via the command line. We don't have much of a choice
                here.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A BRIEF GLOSSARY</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><b>TERMINAL</b> -- A text-based interface to your computer. Originally a physical object but now we use
                software terminals.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>SHELL</b> -- The actual program running on the terminal.</p>
            <p> "BASH" and "Z-SHELL" are two of the most popular shells today.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>BASIC COMMANDS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><b>"ls"</b> stands for list. The terminal will list the current contents of the directory you are in at
                that moment.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>the "~"</b> is a shortcut to your "HOME' directory.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>"pwd"</b> stands for 'Print Working Directory.' Prints the path to the working directory (where you
                currently are).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>"cd"</b> stands for 'Change Directory.'</p>
            <p>IN THE TERMINAL: type "cd *existing directory name*"</p>
            <!-- cd sample -->
            <p>IN THE TERMINAL: type "cd .." to return up one level. THE SPACE IS IMPORTANT!</p>
            <!-- cd .. -->
            <p>You can access ANY 'folder'/'directory' by using "cd /abc/123/xyz" This is known as "ABSOLUTE PATHS" vs.
                "RELATIVE PATHS" which do not use slashes and 'move' you relative to the current directory in use.</p>
            <!-- cd /sample1/sample2/etc -->
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>"mkdir"</b> stands for "make directory." It will create a new directory or directories.</p>
            <!-- mkdir DwarfGoats NormalGoats -->
            <p>Type "mkdir .." to make a new directory, one folder 'above' the current one.</p>
            <!-- mkdir .. -->
            <p>Type "mkdir Frogs/TreeFrogs SugarGliders," as an example, to create two new directories inside of the
                pre-existing /frogs. All inside of /pets</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>"man"</b> stands for manual and is followed by another command, which "manual" will provide a
                description of. This includes a list of parameters called "flags" that can be used with the given
                command. </p>
            <!-- man ls -->
            <p>TYPE "Q" TO EXIT</p>
            <!-- q -->
            <p>Type "ls -l" to access the flag "l", whose function does not matter for now.</p>
            <!-- ls -l -->
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>"touch"</b> creates a new file (or multiple) from the command line.</p>
            <p>Type "touch fileName.txt otherFile.html" or whatever file type (.html, .js, .css, etc.) you want to
                create. List them as shown to create multiple in a single command.</p>
            <!-- touch fileName.type -->
            <p>IF called upon an existing file, it will "touch" it, and update its "last modified" time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>"rm"</b> will <b>PERMANENTLY</b> "remove" the called file.</p>
            <!-- rm file -->
            <p>There is also <b>"rmdir"</b> to remove a directory, but ONLY works if the directory called is empty.</p>
            <!-- rmdir directory -->
            <p><b>"rm -rf"</b> stands for "remove -recursive force", meaning all items inside the called directory
                (recursive) will be deleted without asking permissions (force).</p>
            <!-- VOID DELETE ALL ITEMS IN GIVEN DIRECTORY -->
            <!-- rm -rf target  -->
            <p><b>WARNING!! THERE IS NO TRASH CAN OR RECYCLE BIN TO RECOVER FROM. ENTER THE VOID.</b></p>
        </li>
    </ul>
